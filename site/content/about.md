My name is Dan Brennan. I am a transport planner with an interest in data analysis and programming in languages such as R, Python and Bash. This website is mainly a collection of my own notes on programming, statistics and data analysis. 

The site has been built using the R [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.
